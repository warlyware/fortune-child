        Deprive a person of something, and they will surely go out and find it. In an age where Rock N' Roll has
        fallen by the wayside, few have heeded the call to preserve its integrity and importance in most of the
        music we hear today. It's time to put the question to rest: Rock N' Roll is here to stay, and Fortune Child
        will be commanding the ship.

        Founded in Jacksonville, Florida in 2021, it is no secret that these
        lovers of good ol' fashioned Rock were inspired by the likes of Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Alice in
        Chains, The Black Crowes and so many more. The four-piece band plans to take the Rock N' Roll scene
        by storm, and to remind the people of what truly matters: the music itself.

        The band (Christian Powers/ vocals, Buddy Crump/ lead guitar, Melanie Jo/ drums, and Jon Ward/bass)
        has quickly garnered significant support from the Southeast US Rock N' Roll scene opening for national
        touring acts such as Blacktop Mojo and will continue to do so as they leave crowds wanting more and
        more after each show. It's loud, it's dirty, and it’s down-right badass. Fortune Child is a force to be
        reckoned with. For 2022, the band has partnered with legendary rock producer Kevin Elson of Journey,
        Mr. Big, Europe, and Lynyrd Skynyrd to produce their full length debut album “Close to the Sun”
        out now. It’s one you won’t want to miss!
